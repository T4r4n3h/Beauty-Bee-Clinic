My name is Melania and Iâ€™m Nurse Injector with broad experience in Cosmetic industry. I have been beautifying people since 2011 and in Esthetic world for more than 20 years. My cosmetic injections career started when i went back to nursing school in Canada. I have been trained with the top notch companies such as Allergan, Merz and Galderma. I decided to go independently during the pandemic crisis as a mobile Nurse Injector as of safety of my clients. My business has been booming since clients love their privacy and safety.</p>
